This minimal commenting implementation found at github.com/MarcWeber/vim-addon-commenting just does what I think everybody wants:
comment, uncomment, automatically detects filetype (if either &commentstring or &comments is set correctly).
And it is aware of cursor column. What else do you need (..).

syntax (sublanguage) based commenting? Try tcomment intsead
